Feature preservation --> local changes.
at the same time, do not mess up with the color ordering

obvious color ordering achieved <- predominant component analysis.
 ==> Local changes 

test High - dynamic range images

check filtering effects and simultaneous contrasts from Color Appearance Model


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COLOR ORDERING considering hue changes.

Sometimes strong saturation causes it to look brighter(refer to decolorize)
Adapt it.

However, do not mess up with color ordering unless saturation is high.
In this case, perceptual color ordering makes sense.
However, combination of L and color perceptually might end up having the same greyscale.
In that case, modification is necessary. local mapping likely has artifacts.

I could maybe use some component analysis, I could use different 
Noisy greyscale depending on the high saturation.


CIELAB - Wrong Von Kries model + limitations

contrast filter from the korean paper


--------------------------------------------------------------


Each of inquired conversions ranked the worst for at least
one input image ==> Why?
 ==> Each image has different qualities and characteristics.

 ==> Use Hunt model
 ==> If not applicable, use smith et al.

 ==> I need an adaptive method.


Decolorize good for images with narrow gamuts  --> Maybe I could design nonlinear PCA.
Smith08 good for colorful images

Overall best accuracy: Smith08
Overall best preference: Decolorize

No universally best conversion

Decolorize - color order visually - some users may think that the color order is inaccurate.(perceptually.)


--------------------------------------------------------------
<Good intro>
decolorize -> lack of consistent ordering  ==> need for good ordering.


<Motivation>
Precise -> better perceptually -> make it more precise.
 ==> Choose Nayatani and color reordering(but preventing artifacts)
 ==> Displays good results. Good color ordering depending on hue angles.
 ==> I tried to use Nayatani to generate the axis. However, it did not go well.
       --> I just manipulated on top of the 1st mapped data.(According to Fairchild,
           artificial manipulation may not be accurate. However, it achieves a decent result.)

Show blind test to show how well it detects (discriminability)

Shows it where perceptuality=1.0,effect=0.3/0.1
Shows it where perceptuality=-1.0,effect=0.3/0.1
 ==> To prove that it can reverse color-order
Shows it where perceptuality=1.0,effect=0.1
Shows it where perceptuality=1.0,effect=1.0
 ==> To prove how it can manipulate the intensity of color-ordering
